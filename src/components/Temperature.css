/* scoped the classes to apply to children of a Temperature element */
/*
CSS imports all end up being merged into one CSS file for the project, making
it easy for styles to affect unintended markup. By writing the selector so that
it applies only to a child of .Temperature, we ensure that these rules wouldn't
apply to unrelated markup that happened to use the same class names.

This provides one way to "scope" our style rules.

For a refresher about how the child element selector behaves, refer to:
